with great distinction if he gets into this race they'll be plenty of time to get into the debate in the back and forth but I think everybody should give him the space and respect he deserves to make what is a very difficult choice for him and his family you're going to be giving a big speech on Iran next week at the same time Donald Trump and Ted Cruz really holding a rally on Capitol Hill

helped  together the sanctions that pushed her onto the negotiating table I was the person who explored the early efforts to see whether there could be a negotiation so I believe that the agreement is not perfect it is by no means some kind of validation of a wrong you know my view is don't trust and verify but it is a very important step and it is better than the alternative so on Wednesday I will be outlining in great detail both why I support the agreement but equally importantly what I would do as president to enforce it to hold Iran accountable and to make clear that no options were off the table that they can never ever have a nuclear weapon so this is not only about the agreement and what looks to be its approval by the Congress it's about what comes next and  together the sanctions

adversaries to try to reach the kind of understandings that we have but who will also get up every day and enforce that agreement strongly and vigilantly and I think that's a far better approach than some of the words you will hear from the same day that I deliver my speech from those who apparently don't believe in diplomacy don't believe in the hard work of putting together International Coalition don't believe in trying to get the best deal you can and then don't believe that it needs to be enforced the way that I would enforce it and Donald Trump among other things that he's done has really personally attacked with your clothes to say it to my wedding what was your feeling about that he's attacked so many people including my my clothes Sade and myself and many other people  I

I'm running on and so he can run his own campaign he can and unfortunately do what he's doing which I think is a bad development for our American political system point in raising the question of whether it was appropriate for her to be taking a state department salary and also being paid by an outside company closely associated with your husband by you I was not directly involved in that but everything that she did was approved under the rules as they existed by the state department and so I again he can you know he's great at innuendo and conspiracy theories and really defaming people

I also believe the president United States does have to be careful about what he or she says and I do know sometimes people say well I'm careful about what I say that's because for more than 20 years I've seen the importance of the president of the United States the leader not only of our nation but of the world  I also believe the president United States does have to be careful about what he or she says and I do know sometimes people say well I'm careful about what I say that's because for more than 20 years I've seen the importance of the president of the United States the leader not only have our nation but of the world  I also believe the president United States does have to be careful about what he or she says and I do know sometimes people say when I'm careful about what I say

while I'm careful about what I say that's because for more than 20 years I've seen the importance of the president of the United States the leader not only of our nation but of the world  having to send messages that will be received by all kinds of people loose talk threats insults they have consequences so I'm going to conduct myself as I believe is appropriate for someone seeking the highest office in our country is someone who has such a record in foreign affairs what do you think what you feel when you see these thousands and thousands of migrants men women and children are caught between two worlds unable to get to Germany and Austria with open arms willing to receive right should the United States race photos and permit more people from Syria to come in well the pictures will the stories we've been watching this terrible assault on the Syrian people now four years are just heartbreaking and I think the entire world has to come together it should not be just one or two country  having to send messages that will be received by all kinds of people loose talk threats insults they have consequences so I'm going to conduct myself as I believe is appropriate for someone seeking the highest office in our country is someone who has such a record in foreign affairs what do you think what you feel when you see these thousands and thousands of migrants men women and children are caught between two worlds unable to get to Germany and Austria with open arms willing to receive right shut the United States race photos and permit more people from Syria to come in well the pictures will the stories we've been watching this terrible assault on the Syrian people now four years are just heartbreaking and I think the entire world has to come together it should not be

the entire world has to come together it should not be just one or two country  these are not just Europe and the United States we should do our part as should the Europeans but this is a broader Global crisis we now have more refugees then we've had in many years I think since the second world war and as we've seen tragically people are literally dying to escape the conflict in Syria I think that's the larger Middle East I think Asia I think everybody should step up and say we have to help these people and I would hope that under the Aegis of the United Nations led by the security Council and certainly by the United States which has been such a generous nation in the past we would begin to try to find ways to help people get to Safety in the other lands however that does not solve the problem and the problem is one that entire world now sees doesn't just affect the Syrian people it affects all of us that's what I've been saying  these are not just Europe and the United States we should do our part as should the Europeans but this is a broader Global crisis we now have more refugees then we've had in many years I think since the second world war and as we've seen tragically

that's what I've been saying  years that's why I advocated for a more robust response when Assad began his Onslaught on the Syrian people and I think we have got to come to grips with the fact that this is not going away and the millions of people who are fleeing need safe places to be but the conflict needs to be brought under control failure of the president's policy was the world's policies I mean it's not only the United States I advocated for as I say a more robust policy but sitting here I can't say that that would have on its own made a difference because this had to be a an international effort and of course we know the Russians were standing in the way and I negotiated the agreement in June of 2012 in Geneva which the Russian signed off on and then immediately began to renege so we know that this is not just a problem that the United States can solve we have to do what I did with the Iranian  years that's why I advocated for a more robust response when Assad began his Onslaught on the Syrian people and I think we have got to come to grips with the fact that this is not going away and the millions of people who are fleeing need safe places to be but the conflict

problem that the United States can solve we have to do what I did with the Iranian  sanctions I had to get the Russians I'm bored I had to get the Chinese on board it was not easy but that's the kind of intense of diplomacy that is going to be required in order to stop the flow of refugees and to try to bring some peace and security back to the region we've got a present of China coming later this

health we have done a lot to improve Women's Health particularly lower maternal mortality I in education we have closed the Gap in primary education so that girls are attending at about the same rate as boys but the Gap then comes back and secondary education so we have work to do but if you look at economic rights and participation political rights and participation security and conflict we have a lot to do so it's a it's a glass half filled kind of scenario and as a senator as Secretary of State I argued strongly for putting with  I was very very humbled and proud at the same time to

of State I argued strongly for pudding with  Wright's at the center of foreign policy because when women have rights you're more likely to have a middle-class you're more likely to have more stable families we are more likely to have the opportunity for democracy to take hold and grow so this for me was not only a moral issue a humanitarian issue a a rights and equality issue it was a security and strategic issue and I'm going to continue to make that case there has been progress in China they have a long way to go as so many other countries do but even in advanced economies like our own we don't have equal pay for equal work the minimum wage is what two-thirds of the people on minimum wage or women that's not a a way to get yourself out of poverty we still have our own challenges and

and Madeleine Albright then our ambassador to the UN was the official head of the delegation I was the honorary chair of it and I made it clear that this even though it was 20 years ago was a critical issue about America's values and our interest and our future security so I made the case and I went and I was very pleased that after the speech some of the naysayers contacted me and thanked me for
